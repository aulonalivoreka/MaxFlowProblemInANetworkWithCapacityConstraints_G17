# Max Flow Visualization using Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

This project implements the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method, to solve the **Maximum Flow Problem** in a directed network. The program is written in Python and includes functionality for graph visualization to display the flow distribution.

## Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

The **Edmonds-Karp algorithm** uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find, in each iteration, the shortest augmenting path between the source and the sink. The algorithm works as follows:
1. In each iteration, the **bottleneck capacity** of the path is calculated.
2. A suitable amount of flow is sent along the augmenting path.
3. The process is repeated until no augmenting path exists in the residual network.

### Key Characteristics:
- Each path contains at least one edge.
- A single BFS runs in **O(E)**, where **E** is the number of edges.
- Each edge can be part of an augmenting path at most **V** times, where **V** is the number of vertices.
- The overall worst-case running time is **O(VEÂ²)**.
